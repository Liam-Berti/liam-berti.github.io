Do people even read these anymore?

It's a reasonable question, seems like people would rather share
their inane thoughts on Twitter or something.

Fortunately I can post long form inane comments here, so
that's already an advantage.

I've also made the theme of the blog as simple as possible, while still maintaining plenty of auto-generated HTML bloat. The white background also helps show dirt on my monitor, so that's a bonus.
